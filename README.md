# Project Reflection - Pirate Intelligent Agent

## Project Overview
In this project, I used ideas from reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a problem with a pirate agent. I started with some basic code that set up the environment. I wrote my own code to train the agent, build the model, and help the agent learn better.

## Connection to Computer Science
Computer scientists solve problems by breaking them down into smaller steps. They use coding and math to create solutions that can help people. For this project, I learned how to understand the problem, find out what others have done before, and make my model better step by step.

## Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, it is important to think about how my work affects people who use it. I try to make sure my solutions are fair, clear, and safe. For this project, I wanted to make a model that works well and is also mindful of the limits of reinforcement learning.
